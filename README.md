# 🕵️‍♂️ Network Packet Analyzer (Mock UI)

This project is a **mock web-based network packet analyzer** built just for fun. It simulates the behavior and design of a lightweight packet capture (PCAP) analyzer, similar to tools like Wireshark — but entirely focused on the **user interface and experience**.

> ⚠️ This is a frontend mock only — it does **not perform real packet analysis** (yet).

## 💡 Inspiration

This was built purely for experimentation — as a fun side project to visualize how a modern browser-based packet analyzer might look. It aligns with my interests in:

* 🛡️ Cybersecurity
* 🌐 Network Forensics
* 🧪 Threat Detection and Analysis Tools
